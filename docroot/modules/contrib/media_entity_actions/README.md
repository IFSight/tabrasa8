# Media Entity Actions

This module is intended to serve as a bridge between sites that relied on the
 Actions plugins present on the Media Entity 1.x branch, which were removed in
 Drupal core 8.4.x. You can use this module together with Media in core 8.4.x to
 achieve the same functionality.

Generic entity actions will likely be added to core in future minor versions
 (>8.5.x), at which point this module will become obsolete and an upgrade path,
 if needed, will be provided. See https://www.drupal.org/node/2916740 for more
 information.
