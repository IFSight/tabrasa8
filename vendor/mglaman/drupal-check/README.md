# drupal-check [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mglaman/drupal-check.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mglaman/drupal-check) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mglaman/drupal-check.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mglaman/drupal-check) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mglaman/drupal-check.svg)](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/releases/latest)

Built on [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), this static analysis tool will check for correctness (e.g. using a class that doesn't exist), deprecation errors, and more.

Why? While there are many static analysis tools out there, none of them run with the Drupal context in mind. This allows checking contrib modules for deprecation errors thrown by core.

Are you ready for Drupal 9? Check out our [Drupal 9 Readiness](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/wiki/Drupal-9-Readiness) instructions for details on how this tool can help.

## Requirements

* PHP >=7.2

## Installation

You can install this in your project using Composer as a development dependency like so:

```
composer require mglaman/drupal-check --dev
```

You can also install this globally using Composer like so:

```
composer global require mglaman/drupal-check
```

Refer to Composer's documentation on how to ensure global binaries are in your PATH: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#manual-installation.

## Usage

This tool works on all Drupal code, but must be executed within the root directory of a Drupal project..

### 1. cd into a Drupal Directory

You can run this tool within any Drupal project. But, for best results, create a fresh Drupal directory on the latest Drupal:

```
composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev drupal --no-interaction --stability=dev
cd drupal
```

### 2. Run drupal-check

Usage:

  ```
  drupal-check [OPTIONS] [DIRS]
  ```

Arguments:

* `OPTIONS` - See "Options" for allowed values. Specify multiples in sequence, e.g. `-ad`.
* `DIRS` - One or more directories within the root of a Drupal project.

Options:

* `-a` Check analysis
* `-d` Check deprecations (default)
* `-e` Exclude directories. Wildcards work. Separate multiple excluded directories with commas, no spaces. e.g.: \*/tests/codeception/acceptance/\*.php
* `--drupal-root` Path to Drupal root. Fallback option if drupal-check could not identify Drupal root from the provided path(s).

Examples:

* Check the address contrib module:

  ```
  drupal-check web/modules/contrib/address
  ```

* Check the address contrib module for deprecations:

  ```
  drupal-check -d web/modules/contrib/address
  ```

* Check the address contrib module for analysis:

  ```
  drupal-check -a web/modules/contrib/address
  ```

* Check the address contrib module for both deprecations and analysis:

  ```
  drupal-check -ad web/modules/contrib/address
  ```
